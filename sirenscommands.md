Welcome to the Official [Siren's Commands](https://www.curseforge.com/hytale/mods/sirenscommands) Mod Wiki!

Siren's Commands adds multiple useful commands to your server. This is more of a personal plugin with commands I use to simplify my experience using Hytale.



Commands:
- /sirenscommands, /scmds : to view all commands on the server
- /list, /players : See who is connected to the server
- /gmc, /gma : Sets the player's gamemode
- /top : Sends player to the surface
- /sucide, /die : Kills the player
- /back : Teleports the player to their previous location
- /day, /night : More accurate time to set day or night
